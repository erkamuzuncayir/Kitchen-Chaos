# Kitchen Chaos

This is repository contains a tutored game project.

I noticed that there were multiple bad practises in the code that the instructor described. 
The use of **Singleton**, the use of very simple and expensive methods such as **GetComponent** can be counted as a few examples. In general, there are many different actions taken, *ignoring the possibility of scaling the project*.

In order not to disturb the integrity of the training, I have passed them into my own code as well as without changing them. But these are things that should never be ignored. I try to pay attention to these in the projects I develop myself. You can check my other repositories for reference.
