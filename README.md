# Kitchen Chaos

This is repository contains a tutored game project. 

> This notes will contain what I learn and what I want to remember.

## Notes

### General

1. You can't animate parent object, you can animate child objects with Animation tool.

### Architecture

1. Don't put logic and visual into the same Game Object.
   1. Logic always goes parent object and visual child object.

## Scripting

1. If you're use Vector when making diagonal move, don't forget normalize. Obviously physagor.

#### Clean Code

1. Don't omit private keyword due to escaping from misunderstandings.f
